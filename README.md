# Obstacles
This game prototype was made in Unity during a gamejam.

## Description
I made this prototype during a game jam, where the theme was "Roles Reversed". The goal is to make it through an obstacle course as far as possible, but you control the obstacles. Using your mouse you need to dodge the ball, which goes faster and faster over time.

## Controls
- Mouse: Move next obstacle left or right
- SPACE: Reset speed and score
